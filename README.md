### How do I get set up? ###

* To Start you need the game framework** Phaser (http://www.phaser.io/)**
* The configuration it's simple you just need download the **phaser.js** or **phaser.min.js** and put in your folder project, make the call in your html file and done.
* How to run tests? Well, you cannot check your changes directly in the html file on your web browser, you have to run that local with xamp, wamp, mamp or if you gonna work so much faster you can Brackets or Intel XDK.
* This Project it's a start to understand how Phaser works.
